# 🌿 Prakriti Identification using ML

Machine Learning (ML) is transforming Ayurveda by automating **Prakriti** (body constitution) identification through data-driven models. *Prasna Pariksha*, a traditional assessment method, evaluates the **Tridosha**—**Vata (V)**, **Pitta (P)**, and **Kapha (K)**—based on 20 distinct criteria.

In this project, we enhance the model by incorporating additional user inputs such as water intake, exercise, and sleep patterns to provide **personalized health and lifestyle suggestions**. The app also features a **chat page** where users can share thoughts and images, promoting a collaborative wellness community. We also implemented **2-step OTP verification** to enhance user authentication and security.

The application is developed using:
- **React.js** for the frontend  
- **Node.js** for backend API handling  
- **MongoDB** for database management  
- **Python + Flask** for data training and analysis

Together, they create a seamless user experience with **real-time predictions**, supporting both Ayurvedic practitioners and individuals in making **informed wellness decisions**.
